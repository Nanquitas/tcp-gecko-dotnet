# TCP Gecko dotNet
A 3DS Utility using a network connection. 

This is a little mod of the app made by @Chadderz121 https://github.com/Chadderz121/tcp-gecko-dotnet.
Note: I only edited the basics read / write, so many side features might still need to be updated. Maybe I'll update it with time, maybe not.
Also, no debug functions is currently available (breakpoint / watchpoint / thread / pause etc).

To be able to use it, you need to use the modified ntr.bin available in the repo.

# How to use
You need to launch the modded ntr.bin, then press DPad-Left while launching your app.

Your screen will flash blue and green and be stuck on the loading screen. When it happen, just connect the client to the 3DS, and the game will continue.
